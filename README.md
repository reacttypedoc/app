# React TypeDoc Theme
The goal of this project is to create a single page typedoc theme

### Reasoning
Currently TypeDoc creates individual pages for the documentation.
With the advancements in the web, we can now use single page apps with the history api in order to reduce the time when switching between pages


## Usage
* Create a package.json
* Create docs using the tool

# Roadmap
- webpack the typedoc json into the code
- [ ] Create CLI tool for setup
